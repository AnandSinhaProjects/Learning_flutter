# Learning Flutter

***Why Flutter ?***

Flutter is a code base that is based on the Dart frame work and is a framework that aims to deliver the platform integratrion of native mobile with high velocity development of other frameworks.

It uses mobile first GPU accelarated renderer for fast cutomizable widgets and the widgets load faster and are smoother.

***How to set it up ?***

You can set up your development environment by following the instructions at https://flutter.io/setup for your operating system.

You can use many IDEs for developing Flutter apps, including Android Studio, IntelliJ, and VSCode. You can find instructions for these IDEs at https://flutter.io/using-ide.

I am using **Visual Studio Code** to install this in VS Code you can simply install the flutter and dart extentions to use it a editor and VS Code just like Android Studio has support for both iOS Simulator and Android Emulator.
